#EcoMarine – Smart Water Surface Trash Collector

EcoMarine is a remotely controlled trash collection system designed to clean floating waste from lakes, ponds, and other still water bodies. The system is built around a Raspberry Pi, which controls the movement of the boat and the conveyor belt using two L298N motor driver modules and DC motors. 
The conveyor mechanism collects floating waste and directs it into a storage container mounted on the boat. A webcam is integrated with the system to provide live video feed, which can be viewed directly from a custom Android application. The app also includes directional control buttons that allow the user to navigate the boat and operate the conveyor remotely, ensuring easy handling even from a distance.

#Features:

Remote boat navigation via mobile app.

Live camera streaming for real-time monitoring.

Dual motor control for boat movement and waste collection.

Low-cost and easy to maintain hardware design.
